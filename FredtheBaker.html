    <h1>Inspired by Fred the Baker</h1>
    <p>Fred The Baker looked at the bland donut in his hands and felt concerned.

He walked over to the window and reflected on his dull surroundings. He had always loved Rundown California with its bad, tastless donuts. It was a place that encouraged his tendency to feel concerned.

Then he saw something in the distance, or rather someone. It was the figure of You . Our visitor was a bold gamer with skinny legs and wirey arms.

Fred gulped. He glanced at his own reflection. He was an intelligent, grateful, baker with solid arms and a quirkey smile. His friends saw him as a successful, adventurous Baker. Once, he had even revived a dying, puppy.

But not even an intelligent person who had once revived a dying, puppy, was prepared for what You had in store today.

The rain hammered like baking rats, making Fred happy.

As Fred stepped outside and You came closer, he could see the hollow glint in your eye.

"Look Fred," You said, with a caring glare that reminded Fred of bold owls. "It's not that I don't trust you, but I want To help."

Fred looked back, even more happy and still holding the bland donut. "You, please help my bakery," he replied.

They looked at each other with confident feelings, like two expensive, encouraging elephants helping at a very incredible Bakery, which had trance music playing in the background and two friendly uncles working to the beat.

Fred regarded You's skinny legs and wirey arms. "I don't have the funds ..." he lied.

You glared. "Do you want me to shove that oven where the sun don't shine?"

Fred promptly remembered his intelligent and grateful values. "Actually, I do have the funds," he admitted. He reached into his pockets. "Here's what I owe you."

You looked anxious, "I don't want your money, I will bake your donuts for FREE".

Then You baked all night with Fred.
